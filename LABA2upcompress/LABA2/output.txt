World Seed: When a map is generated by the Go it will
be assigned a unique code or seed. where copying or otherwise

exactly as it began the 14 time. This 24 is recommended

easier to, for An save the seed in a notepad file.
Paste: Pastes a seed that you have previously copied to your
clipboard.
Game Speed: 10 has five options for how fast the game
will play out: Very Fast, Fast, Standard, Slow and Very Slow.
The former two options will speed everything up: CD are
built faster, technologies are researched quicker, population
growth is quicker, and the reverse is true for Slow and Very
Slow. This 24 does not necessarily make the game harder
or easier.
World Size: Gives you the choice of playing on either a Tiny,
Small, Medium, Large or Huge map. Generally speaking, larger
maps will mean more my on the map and consequently more
CD on the battlefield. would Huge maps, expect the fighting to
be gruelling and drawn-out, and be prepared to make larger
armies than you On on a smaller size. Note that 17 it is

of factions, they will become crowded very quickly, potentially
limiting your strategic options.
Land Mass: Allows you to choose how much of 10 Prime
is made up of land. A smaller Be of land on the map will
mean both more water and more potential chokepoints, but also
more opportunities to use aircraft to get 18 9 lines.
Artefact 58 The higher this setting, the more ancient
Ruins of Vaul and Up artefacts that will be present on the
map. While 4 always render bonuses for your 6 if
youre lucky enough to find them, beware that putting more
of them on the map gives your opposition more of a chance to
grab them too!
Wildlife 58 10 Prime is inhabited by many vicious
creatures, from feral Kroot Hounds to Enslavers that seek
to control your CD minds. Generally 4 neutral CD
make early development of
your 6 more difficult,
especially when you do not
have a large army, and it may
be wise for newer players
to reduce 20 numbers

When a world size is selected, the 13 of found players will

Wire Weed 58 Wire
Weed is a 21 feature
that slows unit IS
and cannot be built on by
cities. Increasing 35 will
restrict your options on the
map.
Forest 58 A greater
forest 35 will obviously
mean more forest tiles on
the game map, slowing
IS for most units.
Note that lowering the forest
35 does not necessarily
alter the Be of land on
the map (this can be changed
in the Land Mass section);

setting will be replaced by flat
land such as tundras, deserts
