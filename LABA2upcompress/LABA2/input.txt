Gladius Prime, once a peaceful planet units a rich archaeological
history, now finds itself locked in a war units the greatest powers
of the galaxy that arose as relics were explored and lands colonised.
Four very different factions: Space Marines, Necrons, Orks and the
Astra Militarum all vie for control of the planet, combatting both
the wildlife, and each other. Heroes will rise, Armies will fall, and in
the end there can only be one victor. It is the 41st millennium, and
there is only war!

When you open Gladius: Relics of War (hereafter referred to as simply
Gladius), the first thing you will see is the main menu. Here you
are presented with a range of options, the most important being the
button that allows you to begin a game of Gladius.
Continue: Immediately loads your most recent single-player
savegame. This game may be either player-made or an autosave,
the latter being likely if you forgot to save at the end of your
last session. Note that the first time you open Gladius (or any
other time that no saves exist), this option will be unavailable.
New Game: Takes you to the screen that will allow you to set
up a new single-player game of Gladius, giving you numerous
options, from the number of computer opponents to the size
of the map of Gladius Prime. This is discussed in further detail
in the next section.
10 11
Load Game: Allows you to choose any single- or multiplayer
save game of Gladius from your hard drive to load. There is no
limit to the number of save games which may be kept on your
hard drive.
Multiplayer: Opens the multiplayer lobby, where you can set
up and continue internet-based multiplayer games of Gladius
Settings: Allows you to customise various gameplay, video and
audio settings for Gladius.
Patch Notes: Patches for Gladius will be periodically made
available on the Slitherine and Matrix Games websites, and
installed automatically on the Steam version. Clicking this
button will bring up a list of all the changes made to the game
since its original release. This information can also be found on
both Steam and the Slitherine and Matrix websites.
Credits: Opens a list of all the people that worked on the game.
A list of credits can also be found at the end of this manual.
Quit: Closes Gladius and returns you to your desktop.
Selecting New Game on the main menu will take you to the New
Game Setup Screen, which will present you with a series of options
that may be customised.
Taking up most of the screen will be images of the various factions
taking part in the game. The largest image, on the left, represents
the players faction, while smaller portraits represent the various AI
factions (by default, there will be four of these).
Clicking on the portrait representing a faction will allow you to change
which faction that player has, bringing up a screen that explains the
various bonuses and rules applicable to each of the Astra Militarum
(sometimes known as the Imperial Guard),
Necrons, Orks and Space Marines. To select
which faction that player controls, click on one
of the four on the left and then select OK to
return to the New Game Setup Screen.
By clicking on the coloured bar (with the text
You or AI), it is possible to change what
colour will be used to represent that faction
on the map from the several available. No two
factions may use the same colour, and used
colours will not appear in the drop-down menu.
Underneath the colour selection will be a
label for what race this faction commands (for
instance, Necrons. Clicking this will create
a drop-down menu that allows you to quickly
change which race that faction commands.
Underneath the faction portrait will be, by
default, the label No Team. Clicking this will
allow you to form permanent alliances between
two or more factions by assigning them to the same team. Teams share
knowledge of the map and unit bonuses, but have independent stocks
Note
It is also possible to have the game randomly decide which faction
each player will command: just choose the Rando option!
Note
It is possible to have multiple, or even all, factions controlling the
same race. Factions in-game treat other factions of the same race
the same as they would any other race.
12 13
of resources and will not be able to fight each other. Finally there
is the difficulty option, which can be adjusted individually for each
faction. Factions using difficulty settings other
than Sergeant or its equivalent will be assigned
either a penalty or bonus to unit morale, the size
of that change being dependent on exactly which
difficulty is selected.
Depending on the faction, the name of equivalent difficulty levels is
often different. The following table shows the equivalent difficulties,
arranged by faction:
Equivalent to Astra
Militarum
Space
Marines Orks Necrons
Powerless - (Maximum
Morale Disadvantage for
that faction)
Conscript Neophyte Squig Flayed
One
Very Weak Guardsman Battle
Brother Grot Warrior
Weak
(No Advantages) Sergeant Sergeant Boy Immortal
Normal
(AI Default) Commissar Captain Nob Triarch
Praetorian
Strong General Chapter
Master Boss Cryptek
Very Strong Lord
Commander Primarch Warboss Overlord
Unyielding - (Maximum
Morale Advantage for
that faction)
Warmaster Emperor
Prophet
of Gork
and Mork
Silent King
Note
This means that the easiest possible setting would be to have your
faction set to Warmaster or its equivalent, while all AI players are
set to Conscript or its equivalent.
The large plus (+) symbol allows you to add additional AI factions
(up to a maximum of thirteen players or twelve AIs). By default these
will always appear set to Random Faction with normal difficulty, but
these can be changed to whatever option you may prefer.
On the right of the screen is a list of options that can be adjusted,
customising various aspects of the map itself:
World Seed: When a map is generated by the game, it will
be assigned a unique code or seed. By copying or otherwise
recording a past maps seed, it becomes possible to replay a map
exactly as it began the first time. This option is recommended
only for advanced players.
Randomize: Creates a new map seed using the settings
included in the other boxes on the screen.
Copy: Copies the map seed to your clipboard. This makes it
easier to, for instance, save the seed in a notepad file.
Paste: Pastes a seed that you have previously copied to your
clipboard.
Game Speed: Gladius has five options for how fast the game
will play out: Very Fast, Fast, Standard, Slow and Very Slow.
The former two options will speed everything up: units are
built faster, technologies are researched quicker, population
growth is quicker, and the reverse is true for Slow and Very
Slow. This option does not necessarily make the game harder
or easier.
World Size: Gives you the choice of playing on either a Tiny,
Small, Medium, Large or Huge map. Generally speaking, larger
maps will mean more cities on the map and consequently more
units on the battlefield. On Huge maps, expect the fighting to
be gruelling and drawn-out, and be prepared to make larger
armies than you would on a smaller size. Note that while it is
14 15
possible to play the smaller maps with the maximum amount
of factions, they will become crowded very quickly, potentially
limiting your strategic options.
Land Mass: Allows you to choose how much of Gladius Prime
is made up of land. A smaller amount of land on the map will
mean both more water and more potential chokepoints, but also
more opportunities to use aircraft to get around enemy lines.
Artefact Density: The higher this setting, the more ancient
Ruins of Vaul and other artefacts that will be present on the
map. While these always render bonuses for your faction if
youre lucky enough to find them, beware that putting more
of them on the map gives your opposition more of a chance to
grab them too!
Wildlife Density: Gladius Prime is inhabited by many vicious
creatures, from feral Kroot Hounds to Enslavers that seek
to control your units minds. Generally these neutral units
make early development of
your faction more difficult,
especially when you do not
have a large army, and it may
be wise for newer players
to reduce their numbers
until they become more
experienced.
Note
When a world size is selected, the number of AI players will
automatically adjust to the recommended amount. This can be
easily changed by adding or removing factions using the plus (+)
and cross (X) buttons.
Special Resource Density:
Special resources, such as
Grox Pastures, are terrain
features that provide largerthan-usual benefits to resource
production in nearby cities. A
greater resource density will
mean that more of these are
present on the map, and that cities will develop slightly faster.
Ruins of Vaul Density: Ruins
of Vaul are terrain features
that can provide substantial
bonuses to your factions
research rate, and provide
benefits to the first unit to
walk on them. Increasing
ruin density will tend to
mean that technology is discovered slightly faster by all factions.
Jokaero Trader Encampment
Density: Trader Encampments
provide an influence bonus to
cities that include one within
their boundaries, and in the
later portion of the game
they can also be used by
hero units to acquire various
traits and weapons. Increasing the density will make these more
common on the map.
Necron Tomb Density: The Necrons faction is unique in that
it is only able to construct its cities on tiles that include Necron
Tombs. As a result, increasing the tomb density will give the
16 17
Necrons more possible
locations, and will make the
game easier for them (and
arguably harder for other
players). We recommend that
new players who wish to try
out the Necrons increase tomb
density for their first game.
Wire Weed Density: Wire
Weed is a terrain feature
that slows unit movement
and cannot be built on by
cities. Increasing density will
restrict your options on the
map.
Forest Density: A greater
forest density will obviously
mean more forest tiles on
the game map, slowing
movement for most units.
Note that lowering the forest
density does not necessarily
alter the amount of land on
the map (this can be changed
in the Land Mass section);
forests on a lower density
setting will be replaced by flat
land such as tundras, deserts
and grasslands instead.
River Density: Rivers slow
movement and can increase
food production in cities that build on them. Increasing river
density will tend to slow down armies but will speed up city
development.
Once you are satisfied with your settings, select Start to begin your
game!
Once a game has begun, the majority of the screen will now be
covered by the main map. This is where the vast majority of your
actions in Gladius will take place: armies are moved on the map, cities
are founded here, resources are harvested and artefacts explored here.
The map, like that of many other strategy games, is divided into
hexagonal-shaped tiles, frequently nicknamed hexes. Each hex
will have its own terrain type, such as tundra, volcanic or grassland.
18 19
Some hexes will include natural features, such as rivers or forests,
and some may include unnatural features, such as an artefact or a
Necron Tomb. The latter are especially important to anyone playing
as the Necrons, as those are the only places where Necron cities may
be founded. (Perhaps it would be a good idea to block them off as
another faction?)
The other common terrain is a water-filled tile: labelled coast if it
is adjacent to a land tile, or ocean if it is not. Coasts and Oceans
are impassable for all units
except flying ones (flying units
are unlocked later in the game),
and cities may not build on them.
They yield no resources and hold
little strategic value besides the
possibility of sending a swarm
of bombers around the enemy
defense line to hit his rear.
Try hovering over one of the hexes with your mouse cursor. A popup will appear after a brief period of time. This pop-up will tell you
many useful things about that hex, including the terrain type and
co-ordinates of the hex. In addition, any special features, including
forests, artefacts or rivers will be visible, along with the name of a
unit that may be present. Most importantly, any resources that the
terrain can provide (as a city-wide percentage bonus) will be listed,
as well as the number of building slots available if a city is founded
or expanded into that hex.
Initially however, only a couple of dozen hexes will be revealed, with
everything around them being covered in black clouds. These black
clouds cover areas of the map once known but now forgotten, and they
are now considered terra incognita, unknown land. Terra incognita
can be pushed away by simply moving a unit to a hex within a units
sight range of it, revealing the hex underneath permanently.
But not totally permanently. As soon as your unit moves away from
that tile, the clouds will return to form what is known as the fog of
war. The terrain type itself will still be visible, as will any artefacts
or other things that were there when the tile was explored. Enemy
units, however, will become invisible, hidden by the fog of war, and
you will not be notified if an artefact you ignored is claimed by
another faction. Do not allow yourself to be fooled by the fog of war:
tread carefully as you explore the forgotten lands of Gladius Prime.
20 21
Speaking of artefacts, if you discover an unexplored Ruin of Vaul or
another artefact (hovering over the artefact will tell you if it has been
explored by another faction yet or not), you should aim to move a
unit into it as soon as possible. Artefacts are guaranteed to provide
a bonus to the first faction that walks into them, so unless there is
dangerous wildlife or an enemy army near them, you should seek to
claim as many as you can before they are all taken by your enemies.
On the borders of the screen surrounding the map will be a series of
black boxes and information panels.
The most important of these is the resource listings in the top-left
corner of the screen. Depending on your chosen faction, you will
see only the resources that your factions inhabitants are worried
about: for instance the Necrons do not worry about food while only
the Space Marines care about requisition points. Each resource is
denoted by a coloured icon, and then two numbers. The numbers
represent both the current stockpile and the projected growth or
loss of that resource between now and the next turn. For instance, a
purple symbol followed by 58 (+18) means that currently you have
58 energy, and unless the situation changes
drastically you will have 18 more influence
points next turn, for a total of 76.
Hovering over each resources numbers will give a breakdown of
exactly what is causing the stockpile of that resource to change.
This will usually be due to buildings in cities producing the resource
while units or population use it up, while other factors such as loyalty
can have either a small or massive impact at times. If you notice
that resource stockpiles are ever decreasing, it is essential that you
construct the appropriate building or disband unnecessary units as
soon as possible.
To the right of the resource listings will be a turn
counter, telling you how many turns have elapsed
since the beginning of your game. Also here is
an indicator that tells you what race you are commanding and shows
what colour you are represented by on the map in case you forgot.
In the top right corner is a button that will allow you to access a
smaller version of the Main Menu, where you can save or load a
game, alter your graphics and audio settings or leave Gladius entirely.
If you clicked on this by mistake, you may return to your game by
pressing Continue.
Underneath the Menu button are five more buttons, represented by
a book, scroll, flag, exclamation and question marks. Each of these
opens a screen that provides more information on various aspects of
your faction that dont directly involve your cities or units. From left
to right these are:
Research: opens a screen that allows you to decide
which weaponry or construction projects your faction
should attempt to develop. As the game continues,
having a wide range of advanced weapons will prove very helpful
in ensuring that it is your faction that controls Gladius Prime.
Quests: Brings up a list of your past and current
quests that have been issued throughout the game.
Because it is possible to win the game by completing
all of your quests, you should check this screen often.
Compendium: Opens up the Compendium, an ingame encyclopedia with entries on every unit,
faction, building, trait and item in the game. Check
here whenever you discover an enemy unit or just something
youre not totally sure about, and you will have an advantage
over your opponents.
22 23
Below these will be information on your current research project,
telling you how many turns (at the current rate of research point
development) and research points are needed to complete the
advancement your engineers are attempting to develop. Clicking
here will take you to the research screen.
From the beginning of Turn 2, when you are given your first quest,
the requirements for your current quest will also be listed. Clicking
on this will take you to the Quest screen, where you will find the
rewards for that chapter of the quest, as well as some lore and the
past quests that you have already completed.
Along the right-hand side of the screen may be a series of notifications
relevant to the current turn. These may include the discovery of
enemy units (including wildlife), an artefact being revealed from
the fog of war or being explored, the founding of a city and more.
Clicking on one of these will take you to the relevant Compendium
entry for further information.
Finally you can find the button to
end your turn and allow the AI
to make its move. If you have not yet moved all of your units, this
button will instead instruct you to move your units. If you do not
wish to do that, the button next to it, with a white arrow, can instead
be used to force-end the turn, leaving those units doing nothing
until the next turn.
Below that is the minimap, which
will give the locations of cities and
known units as coloured dots. In
addition, hexes obscured by the
fog of war will be darkened and
totally unexplored regions will be
black. The minimap can be used to
see at a glance where the holes in
your factions defense lie, as well as helping you find your next target
quickly. Clicking on the minimap will quickly zoom the rest of the
map to focus on that part of the world.
Cities are the most important part
of your faction: they allow you to
extract resources, build units and
maintain control over an area. Lose
all of your cities, and you will be out
of the game. Lose a well-developed
one in the late game, and you might
wish you were knocked out of the
game anyway.
When you begin a game of Gladius, one of your two units
that you begin the game with will be your factions
equivalent of an engineer. Unless your starting location is
absolutely terrible, you will want to found a city on the first turn
(every turn you spend wandering around looking is a turn your rivals
are using to get ahead). This is done by pressing the Found City
button on the engineer unit, or in the case of the Space Marines, the
Deploy City command under the Operations bar at the top of your
screen. Your city
will begin the
game as a single
tile structure, but
it wont be long
before your cities
can rival the
great Imperial
Hive Worlds.
24 25
Once a city has been founded, a defensive tower will automatically
be created in the hex it was founded in. These towers are quite
powerful and in the early game it will take an enormous amount of
force to defeat one (although if you can build mighty Baneblades or
Gargantuan Squiggoths, this may not be the case anymore). They
can also bombard enemy units, usually out to two tiles away though
this can vary depending on which weapons they are equipped with.
This will require any serious attempt to take them to involve a serious
investment of force and resources.
You can explore your own cities by clicking on their name label on
the map. A sidebar will then appear on your screen detailing the net
resource output of that city for the various resources. In addition, all
of the buildings in the city will be listed, along with their resource
output or upkeep costs. Underneath some building will be buttons
allowing you to order them to produce units or other buildings, as
well as the option to acquire tile, giving your city more building
room. The number of buildings each hex can hold is limited by the
number of building slots in that hex, while the number of buildings
operating at once is limited by your citys population.
From the moment you begin the game, you will be interacting
with units. Units are used to build cities, units are used to explore
the landscape, units are used to kill your enemies. Proper unit
management is one of the most important skills in the game, and
without it your games will be short and miserable.
Units are marked on the map by a small group of figures
(or in the case of larger units, one more imposing figure)
within a hex. More usefully however, is the small square
plate above each unit. The icon on the plate tells you what unit it is (if
it looks unfamiliar, you can mouse over it to find out), while the
colour of that icon determines which faction it belongs to. Also on
the plate will be two bars: one for how many hitpoints it has remaining
(a full bar means full strength), and another one for morale.
In order for you to make a unit do anything, first it must be selected,
which is done by clicking on the unit on the map (or the plate just
above). A selected unit will show a green circle underneath it on the
map, and a panel on the side of the screen will appear with details
about the unit. If the option Auto-cycle units is enabled in Settings,
the game will automatically select your next unit when a previous
one has finished moving provided there are no enemies within range
to attack.
This panel lists several important aspects about your units, each
marked by a small icon. The most common ones are listed as follows:
Armour: Some units carry armour, which reduces the
amount of damage they will suffer from enemy attacks.
Each point of armour reduces damage by approximately 8%
Hitpoints: How much health your unit has. When this
value is reduced to zero, your unit will die and be
permanently eliminated from the game.
Morale: A counterpart to hitpoints, morale tells you
how mentally fit for fighting your unit is. If this value
drops below 66%, the damage your unit does will be reduced
by one fourth and the unit is said to be shaken. When morale
falls to less than 33%, the damage is further reduced to merely
one half, and the unit is said to be broken, however even if it
Note
A city with multiple buildings can be building multiple things at once.
For instance, a city with the relevant buildings can build both a unit
and a new building at the same time.
26 27
falls to 0% the unit will not necessarily die (although it almost
certainly will die unless it can retreat quickly).
Actions: An action is any task a unit conducts other
than simple movement, and performing one usually
means that your unit will not be allowed to move again until
the next turn. The most common action is simply attacking a
rival unit, but special units such as heroes can also conduct
more sophisticated actions such as teleportation.
Movement: How many hexes your unit may move that
turn. Note that some hexes require multiple movement
points to cross, while moving to a hex adjacent to an enemy
unit will use all of your units remaining points.
Sight Radius: How far the unit is able to see, that is
to lif the fog of war from a tile. For many early units,
this is equal to one turns worth of movement. Certain terrain
features including cliffs and forests can obstruct this distance,
occasionally making only the adjacent hex visible.
Experience Level: Taking part in fights will eventually
see your units become more skilled as more of their
ranks are filled with hardened veterans. For every level beyond
the first, the units strength in both attack and defense will
increase by 10%.
On the next row will be a list of weapons. The different weapons
that a unit carries will determine both how many hexes away a
unit can be for it to target and how powerful an attack is. Mousing
over each weapons icon will bring up a popup that explains the
various attributes of a weapon, including damage, range, accuracy
(which determines how likely it is that an enemy unit will actually
be damaged), armour penetration (which determines its usefulness
against heavily armoured units such as tanks), any special effects that
apply to the weapon and more.
An example of these is ammunition (or ammo). While
basic weapons have a limitless supply (although there may
be a turn cooldown between uses), some weapons come with only a
limited amount of ammo. Ammo cannot be regained automatically,
and the weapon will have to be acquired again if you run out.
Below weapons will be another line of icons.
These represent the various traits that the unit
currently has, which can provide bonuses or penalties to the unit.
Some of these will be faction-specific (Ork units for instance have
a trait that boosts morale), others unit-specific (for instance, some
units are immune from the movement penalty through forests) and
occasionally a situation-specific trait will be present, such as one to
indicate that a unit is currently in a forest. Each of these is listed in
the Compendium, and details can also be found by mousing over the
respective icon.
The final three rows will be filled with a series
of large buttons. Each of these represents an
order that you can give your unit by clicking on
it. Some of these are simple tasks like heal or
disband (note that this will delete your unit, saving you on upkeep
costs but potentially damaging your defensive capabilities. Use with
caution!), but more advanced units such as heroes will have a much
Note
Experience is gained by all units that have fought against an enemy
unit once that enemy dies, even if they did not fight that turn. This
means that if one unit is heavily wounded and another one comes
in to finish off the rival, both will benefit an equal amount once the
rival dies.

larger variety of orders. Many of these use up action points for that
turn, so keep this in mind if you have plans for your units to do
something else first.
A lot of time in Gladius is spent moving your units around.
Engineers are sent to build new cities. Scouts are sent to explore the
lands. Armies are moved into positions from which they can better
fight their foes. Mastering unit movement is essential to victory in
Gladius, and this section hopes to make that easier.
With the exceptions of immobile units such as defensive towers
in cities, most units have a number of movement points, which
are displayed on the panel on the left of the screen when a unit is
selected. Each turn, the amount of movement points is reset to its
maximum value (so basic infantry units always begin the turn with
three, for example).
The amount of movement points your unit has denotes
how far it is allowed to move. Having three movement
points means that the unit may move three hexes each turn. Note that
some hexes, such as ones containing forests and rivers, cost multiple
points to enter, while moving into a hex directly adjacent to an enemy
unit will use up all of a units movement points. Cliffs (those rocky
formations on hex borders) cannot be crossed directly and must be
walked around – no amount of movement points can change this.
When a unit is selected, a green border will be visible on the map
covering an area around the unit. This marks out how far that unit is
allowed to move within one turn. If you want to move farther than the
green border, right click on the hex you want to move your unit to, and
it will move there immediately. Be aware that even if you did not order
your unit to travel to one of the hexes at the edge of the green region,
all movement points will be used up for that turn. In Gladius, it is not
possible to split movement points within the one turn.
If you instead want to move further than the green border, you are
still allowed to click on a more distant hex. Before you release the
right mouse button, a line of green arrows will be marked out on the
map, along with gear symbols showing where the unit would stop each
turn (they cant use more than their maximum number of movement
points each turn). The unit will then automatically move towards the
more distant tile each turn until it reaches it. It will always take the
fastest route possible, but this may not always be the safest route, so be
careful when giving units long-ranged movement orders.
Note
You are still allowed to change your units order before it reaches
the distant hex, as long as it has not used up its movement points
for that turn.

Basic attacks are done in much
the same way, by right clicking
on an enemy unit within range.
An attack requires that you
have a weapon with sufficient
range and at least one point
of ammo (if this is limited), as
well as the unit having at least
one action point. You do not
require movement points in
order to attack, so it is possible
to move to the absolute edge of
the green border for movement and then attack an adjacent unit (or
in some cases, a unit two or more hexes away) all within the one turn.
If you right click on an enemy unit, a prognosis will appear on
the side of the screen telling you how many casualties both
sides should expect to suffer. Note that this is not 100% accurate: units
can, and frequently will, suffer more or less casualties, but the prognosis
should give a result close to the true outcome of the battle. If you are
happy, right click to attack the unit. This will also use up all of your
units movement points for the turn, in addition to an action point.
In order to survive against the fierce competition that your rivals will
put up, it is essential to acquire and maintain a technological lead
wherever possible. This is done by producing research.
Research points are a form of resource, similar to ore or requisitions,
and can be obtained by the same means as any other resource: certain
buildings can generate them, they can be found on some tiles and
the presence of some artefacts (including Ruins of Vaul) within city
boundaries will generate them. In addition, cities with high loyalty
will see a slight increase in research production.
Research points are then spent in the research screen, which is accessed
by clicking on the book icon in the top right corner of the screen, or
alternatively by clicking on No Research Selected (this will display
the name of the technology being researched instead if applicable).
Discovering technologies is done by investing research points into
them over a number of turns, until enough have been accumulated
for the technology to be understood by your population. At that
point, you will be presented with a popup informing you that the
tech has been discovered, so that you can tell your scientists to begin
work on another project.
In the Research Screen, technologies are divided into ten tiers.
You begin the game with only access to tier one, but once you
Note
Even if you kill an enemy unit in combat, your unit will not move to
the hex that has been vacated as a result
32 33
have discovered two from tier one
the techs from the second tier
will become available, two from
tier two to unlock tier three and
so forth. Some techs have the
additional requirement that you
have researched another tech first
(possibly from the same tier, usually
from a previous one).
This is made easier by the fact that
all techs currently available for
research are highlighted by white
writing. Ones that are unavailable are
greyed, while techs you have already
discovered are in blue. To choose which project you want to begin
investing research points into, simply click on it and then press OK.
In a number of cases, it is possible to begin researching techs that allow
the construction of buildings that are then used to build certain units
(for instance, buildings that make aircraft). This does not necessarily
mean you will be able to build said unit immediately afterwards, as
many units also have their own technology requirement.
The Compendium is an in-game source that contains information
on many important game aspects. It is usually accessed using the
button in the top right corner of the screen when you are in a game,
and clicking on many of the notifications on the right hand side of
the screen will also take you to the relevant compendium entry.
The Compendium is divided into seven sections, with each one then
being broken up into dozens of articles on the different forms that
that game aspect can come in:
Buildings: Here you will find the costs and benefits that each
building in the game can add to your faction, as well as any relevant
information such as what unit types it unlocks for construction.
Factions: Contains articles on the Astra Militarum, Necrons,
Orks and Space Marines. Each explains the special rules that
each faction abides by (for instance, different resources being
usable only by that faction), as well as some lore to explain that
factions role in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.
Features: All of the different things you might find on the map,
from simple Grassland terrain to an explanation of Shards of
Vaul are found here. Depending on the feature, you will find
information explaining how it affects movement, resources,
combat or a combination of those.
Note
it is possible to change your research project mid-tech, but beware
that this will cause you to lose ALL progress on the tech you are
abandoning.
34 35
Items: Explains the different items that may be carried by hero
units and their various effects on combat.
Tips: A list of the all of the tutorial tips. If you have forgotten
how a game concept works, this is the quickest way to remind
yourself.
Traits: This section explains the various traits that units can
be affected by at any one time, whether they be caused by an
event (such as exploring an artefact) or simply by what faction
you are playing as.
nits: A list of every unit in the game (including neutral
wildlife), including movement and combat stats, explanations
of the different weapons that they carry, traits, actions they can
carry out (for instance, founding a city), cost and upkeep.
Once your cities are running smoothly and your armies are well
established, you will eventually start thinking about how you are
going to finally confirm your superiority over your rivals by winning
the game. There are two ways to do this:
Outright global conquest of Gladius Prime, crushing all of
your rivals into dust. The method to this is simple: build the
biggest army with the best guns, and keep fighting until there
is no one left to fight.
Establish your factions presence on Gladius Prime by
completing all of your factions quests.
The ques is a series of challenges and tasks that you are instructed
to fulfill as the game progresses. The exact requirements of them
vary wildly, with everything from building an army to discovering
certain technologies to hoarding resources. At each stage, you will
be rewarded for completing a chapter of the quest, usually with
something related to the task. For instance, researching a food
production technology may give you food, while building a barracks
might instead provide you with a free unit.
The first quest unlocks at the beginning of the second turn, and there
is no time limit to completing them. Subsequent chapters of the quest
are unlocked as you complete the previous ones, so if you want to win
using this method then it would be a good idea not to waste time!
In addition to the regular
fog of war, some (usually
infantry) enemy units can
also be obscured from view
if they are in a forest. The
forests will not be covered by
the dark clouds that show the
fog of war, but the unit inside
them will only be visible if a
friendly unit (whether yours
or another faction on your
team) is adjacent. Beware of enemy units waiting in forests for the
chance to finish off your wounded units.
Once you have reached the second technology tier and researched
the appropriate tech, it will be possible to build hero units in cities
36 37
with the required buildings. Hero units are much stronger than
regular infantry units, and have access to powerful traits and abilities
that lesser units don have.
Among these is the ability to access the shop at a Jokaero Trader
Encampment. To use this, move your hero unit on to a hex with the
Encampment, and click the shop button that will appear in the panel
on the bottom-left corner of the screen.
At the shop, you will be able to buy and sell items for your
unit by spending influence points. On the left hand side
of the shop screen will be a list of all the items that the
hero is currently carrying, as well as how many items it is allowed
to carry and your factions influence point stockpile. To sell an item,
just click on it and it will be removed from your unit, with half of the
items value being returned to your influence stockpile.
Buying items is done the same way in the middle of the screen. The
cost of an item is shown underneath its name, and you can hover the
mouse over an item for a tooltip to appear and explain what the item
will do. Some items are considered passive, and will net your unit (or
sometimes the whole faction) a bonus for as long as they are held.
Others (such as grenades) have a limited number of harges, the
number of times you can use that item. Once the item has run out of
charges, it will disappear forever, and you will have to return to the
Encampment to buy another one should you wish to use it again.
Once you are satisfied with your purchases
(or you want to leave without purchasing
anything), you can click the OK button to
return to the map screen. On the bottom left
corner of the screen, a new panel will show
Note
Jokaero Trader Encampments have an infinite supply of items, and
will never run out no matter how many times you purchase the
same item.

the items that your hero is now carrying. If one of these items is a
grenade or similar single-use item, clicking one of those buttons will
allow you to use that item.
Once the middle tiers of the tech
tree have been researched and
appropriate buildings constructed,
it will be possible for your faction
to build aircraft units.
Aircraft are controlled the same
way other units are, and they
attack no differently to ground
units. They do however have more
options when moving: they can fly straight over cliffs (while ground
units are forced to go around them), they are not slowed by forests
or other terrain obstacles, and they are the only units that can cross
water (coast or ocean) tiles.
Some aircraft also have the ability to transport units across
the map. These units will have the trait. If you
want to load a unit onto a transport, simply move that unit into the
hex containing the transport aircraft. Once units are loaded on the
transport, a menu will appear labelled Cargo, with icons for all of
the units currently loaded. To unload, click and drag one of the icons
onto a hex on the map and that unit will leave the transport and
move to that hex.
Scattered across the map will be
several double-pyramid structures
called artefacts. These are special
units that do not fight and cannot
be moved, but award their faction
various bonuses, ranging from
increased production in cities to an
increased movement rate.
Artefacts can be captured by moving
a unit next to them and then rightclicking on them, as if to attack
(instead of a red hex to indicate an attack, a blue border will show
that it can be captured). Capturing the artefact will allow your
faction to take advantage of its benefits for as long as you control
it (your rivals will not take kindly to capturing the artefact, and are
likely to try to take it back).
Some artefacts, such as the Old One Obelisk, award special traits to
your units (in the case of the Obelisk, the trait will provide a 25%
melee damage bonus). These traits will be present only as long as you
command the artefact, and will disappear if a rival captures it.
The first thing you should consider when beginning your game of
Gladius is where to place your first city. While cities never require the
perfect location (the resources obtained are small in comparison
to the amounts buildings can generate), it is essential that your first

If your transport is destroyed, all the units carried on it will be
destroyed as well!

is well placed – the technology for building engineer units is not
available until the third tier, while the Space Marines cannot build
additional cities at all.
The best location for a city is one with a variety of resources,
especially in the hex it is first built in but also the ones immediately
surrounding it. Most tiles contain one or more bonuses to resource
production – deserts provide a 20% bonus to energy production, while
grasslands provide 40% more food. Once these tiles are acquired by a
city, that bonus is added to the amount that each building in the city
produces of that resource. Obtaining a range of terrain types within
your citys walls will help ensure you have the lead in every resources
production, and can be a major advantage in the game.
Additionally you should see if it is possible to build your city near
an artefact or terrain feature. Arguably the most useful of these are
Ruins of Vaul, which if brought within your borders provides an
even larger bonus to research than is commonly found on the map.
In the days before research buildings are widespread, this can boost
your research to a level that other factions will struggle to match, but
other features exist for the other resources.
These special features can be secured for your faction by having one
of your units end its turn on their hex. When they are captured in
this way, the flat resource bonus (for instance, +2 food from Grox
Pastures) will become immediately available and a small border will
appear around the feature. Take care to defend your ground, as an
enemy unit can usurp control of the feature if it is left unguarded.
The additional percentage bonuses will only become available if a
city acquires their tile, at which point the bonus will be applied to
the entire citys production
